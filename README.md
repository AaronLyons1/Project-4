## FAQ about the uptime script

**Why have you added this script?** -->


First MAJOR issue i have run into. My urls to show the your booking is not working, giving me this error code "Unable to import 'reservation.migrations.views'". I have tried googling, asking slack, asked a friend who is also doing this course with me and asked two friends who are doing software dev in gmit, no one was able to help me sort out the error. Obviously this is a massive error that is a crutial part of the pass criteria. Unfortunately I dont think i will be able to fix this by the time the project is due. I will finish off the code and hope this error doesnt percist.

I had a meeting with the toutor support and he managed to resolve my error regarding the urls.py problem.
